# How to list an asset
See https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-docs/blob/master/exchange/howto/list-asset.adoc

## Step 0.
Fork https://github.com/dalijolijo/bisq-assets

__Create dedicated branch in your fork:__
* list-foo-asset
* list-bitcloud-coin

## Step 1. Implement your asset
Coin implementations must be located within the ``bisq.asset.coins`` package.
Fully-qualified name should be: ``bisq.asset.coins.BitCloud``

## Step 2. Register your asset
Adding __alphabetical__ an entry to the ``META-INF/services/bisq.asset.Asset`` provider-configuration file.

## Step 3. Write tests for your asset (bisq-assets/src/test/java/bisq/asset/coins/)
Create a new ``AbstractAssetTest`` subclass for your asset, named e.g. ``FooCoinTest`` and implement the required methods as appropriate.

## Step 4. Compile and test everything
```
./gradlew build
[...]
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

## Step 5. Create a well-formed Git commit
__Single Commit Message:__
